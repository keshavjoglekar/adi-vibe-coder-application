Hi Keshav,

There's a Wayne Gretzky principle at play here -- don't skate to where the GenAI puck is, skate to where it's going. Your Storynest.ai journey caught my attention because it demonstrates exactly what we're building toward with the Vibe Coder-in-Residence role.

Let's break down what makes this compelling:

**Scale orchestration** -- Your 5x user growth (200K to 1M) while maintaining 98% uptime shows you understand the brutal realities of production AI at scale, not just the demo magic.

**Cost engineering excellence** -- The 54% COGS reduction tells a story about systematic optimization. Building my digital twin isn't just about LLM fine-tuning -- it's about efficiency, measurement, and real business impact.

The role itself is fascinating -- we're essentially reverse-engineering executive workflow friction and turning it into automated GenAI fabric...

Best,
Paul Golding
VP of Edge AI, Analog Devices"""

As founding hire at Storynest.ai, I architected and scaled a multi-model LLM system from 200K to 1M users (5x growth) while achieving 98% uptime. The real breakthrough was systematic cost optimization -- I reduced our COGS by 54% and drove margins to 73%, proving that innovative AI architecture can deliver both technical excellence and business impact.

My background as a former scuba instructor actually translates perfectly to this role -- teaching complex technical concepts under pressure mirrors the challenge of pair-programming with a VP while building their digital twin."""
