The intersection of scale expertise and VP digital twins -- an intriguing conversation

## Voice Authenticity: 87%

Hi Keshav,

There's a Wayne Gretzky principle at play here -- don't skate to where the GenAI puck is, skate to where it's going. Your Storynest.ai journey caught my attention because it demonstrates exactly what we're building toward with the Vibe Coder-in-Residence role.

Let's break down what makes this compelling:

**Scale orchestration** -- Your 5x user growth (200K to 1M) while maintaining 98% uptime shows you understand the brutal realities of production AI at scale, not just the demo magic.

**Cost engineering excellence** -- The 54% COGS reduction tells a story about systematic optimization. Building my digital twin isn't just about LLM fine-tuning -- it's about efficiency, measurement, and real business impact.

Best,
Paul Golding
VP of Edge AI, Analog Devices
