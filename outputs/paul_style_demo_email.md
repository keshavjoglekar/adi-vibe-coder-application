## Subject: Executive AI automation — The pathway beyond prompt engineering

We're entering the era of executive-level AI automation, where the competitive advantage lies not in AI capabilities themselves, but in systematic approaches to multi-objective optimization at the decision-making level.

My work at Storynest.ai represents a first-principles approach to this challenge. Scaling from 200K to 1M+ users while maintaining 98% uptime required more than technical sophistication — it demanded systematic engineering discipline applied to cost optimization. The 54% COGS reduction (56%→26%) wasn't through feature complexity, but through novel multi-model orchestration across Claude, OpenAI, Llama, Grok, and Replicate.

Out of the box GenAI solutions don't get very far for executive workflows, but they're a valuable starting point. Prompt engineering hits a performance limit. Eventually, VPs will need hundreds of carefully tuned agents, each optimized for specific decision contexts.

The pathway to scalable executive AI remains unclear — which is precisely why the Vibe Coder-in-Residence role intrigues me.

My recent validation: selected as top 2 of 100 in India's competitive 24-hour AI development challenge, demonstrates rapid prototyping under extreme constraints. My background teaching life-critical skills as a scuba instructor translates directly to high-stakes executive collaboration — complex concepts under pressure, zero margin for error.

The real frontier lies beyond basic automation: building AI systems that understand executive decision patterns, optimize across multiple stakeholders, and maintain strategic coherence while automating tactical execution.

How do we architect AI that doesn't just process information, but genuinely augments executive judgment? That's the hard problem I'm excited to solve alongside Paul Golding.
