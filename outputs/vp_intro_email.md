Subject: Edge AI Evolution -- Convergence of Scale & Efficiency

Hi Keshav,

The edge AI landscape is experiencing a fascinating inflection point -- particularly as we see the convergence of large language models with embedded systems constraints. From a strategic perspective, this creates both unprecedented challenges and opportunities in architecting AI systems that can deliver cloud-level intelligence within edge computing parameters.

Your work at Storynest.ai caught my attention -- specifically your achievement in scaling from 200K to 1M users while maintaining 98% uptime. This kind of robust scaling expertise -- combined with your demonstrated 54% COGS reduction -- aligns precisely with the challenges we're tackling at ADI as we push the boundaries of edge AI deployment.

What I find particularly compelling is your experience with multi-model LLM architectures across six frameworks -- which opens up interesting possibilities for our next-generation edge AI systems. The architectural implications of efficiently deploying multiple models at the edge -- while optimizing for both performance and power consumption -- is exactly the kind of complex challenge we're focused on solving.

Looking ahead, I see edge AI evolving toward more sophisticated hybrid architectures -- and this is where it gets particularly exciting. Your experience in maintaining high performance while aggressively optimizing resource utilization could be invaluable as we develop these next-generation systems.

Would you be open to a 45-minute discussion next week to explore these synergies in more detail? I'd be particularly interested in hearing your thoughts on the future of multi-model architectures in edge deployment scenarios.

I can make myself available Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon (EST) -- please let me know what works best for you.

Best regards,
Paul Golding
VP of Edge AI, Analog Devices

P.S. Your 79% conversion rate achievement is impressive -- I'd be curious to hear how you approached that optimization problem from an architectural perspective.
