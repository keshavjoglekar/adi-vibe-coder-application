The intersection of scale expertise and VP digital twins -- an intriguing conversation

## Email Body

Hi Keshav,

There's a Wayne Gretzky principle at play here -- don't skate to where the GenAI puck is, skate to where it's going. Your Storynest.ai journey caught my attention because it demonstrates exactly what we're building toward with the Vibe Coder-in-Residence role.

Let's break down what makes this compelling:

**Scale orchestration** -- Your 5x user growth (200K to 1M) while maintaining 98% uptime shows you understand the brutal realities of production AI at scale, not just the demo magic.

**Cost engineering excellence** -- The 54% COGS reduction tells a story about systematic optimization. Building my digital twin isn't just about LLM fine-tuning -- it's about efficiency, measurement, and real business impact.

**Multi-model architecture mastery** -- Six LLM frameworks integrated successfully. This directly maps to our challenge: orchestrating Claude, GPT, and local models in an enterprise environment where failure isn't an option.

The role itself is fascinating -- we're essentially reverse-engineering executive workflow friction and turning it into automated GenAI fabric. Day 1-30 you'll shadow everything, shipping micro-agents that eliminate repetitive touchpoints. By month 4-6, we're aiming for a personal-style LLM that drafts my technical communications indistinguishably from my own voice.

Your conversion optimization background (79% visitor-to-signup) suggests you understand the "metrics or it didn't happen" culture we live in here -- every agent needs telemetry, every automation needs measurable impact.

The Analog Devices context makes this particularly exciting -- we're at $9B revenue with 24,000 people globally, bridging physical and digital worlds at the Intelligent Edge. The productivity gains from getting this right multiply across the entire organization.

I'd love to explore how your systematic approach to scale and optimization could accelerate our digital twin initiatives. Are you available for a conversation about where GenAI executive assistance is heading?

Best,
Paul Golding  
VP of Edge AI, Analog Devices
